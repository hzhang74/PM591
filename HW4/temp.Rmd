### Conceptual
The goal of this exercise is to illustrate the grouping properties of Ridge and Elastic-net compared to Lasso
Compute the full path for of solutions the Lasso, Ridge and elastic net on the data generated below using `glmnet` to generate a full path of solutions:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(glmnet)
# Simulates Features
set.seed(520)

n = 50
x1 = rnorm(n)
x2 = x1
x3 = rnorm(n)
X = cbind(x1, x2, x3)

# Simulates error/noise
e = rnorm(n, sd = 0.1)

#Simulates outcome y
y = 1 + 2*x1 + e
```


```{r ridge}
lambda_grid = 10^seq(2,-2,length=n)
ridge = glmnet(X, y, family='gaussian', alpha=0, standardize=TRUE, lambda=lambda_grid)
ridge_coef = coef(ridge)
round(ridge_coef[, 42:50], 2)
```
